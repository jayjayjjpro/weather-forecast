Weather Tracking App
Overview
The Weather Tracking App allows users to track the current weather conditions of various cities worldwide. The app provides an intuitive user interface that fetches live weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, using a third-party weather API. The app displays weather information for cities and shows results on an interactive map, based on predefined or popular cities.

The app is built using Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for storing the most popular cities being tracked. The app is hosted in the cloud and supports automated deployments via GitHub Actions.
